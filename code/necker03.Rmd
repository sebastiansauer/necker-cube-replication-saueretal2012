# Setup

```{r message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(sjmisc)
library(here)
library(lme4)
library(sjstats)
library(ggformula)
library(broom)
```


Where am I?

```{r}
here::here()
```



## Load data

```{r}
d_long_cleaned <- readRDS(file = paste0(here::here(), "/objects/data-cleaned-rt-level.Rdata"))

d <- d_long_cleaned
```

# Specify models


First, note that we have a crossed design: trials are nested BOTH in persons and blocks.


## `m01`: First shot


```{r}
m01 <- lmer(rt ~ 1 + factor(mindfulness_training) + mindfulness_score + (1|id) + (1|type),
            data = d)

print(m01)
```

We see that mindfulness training *lowers* the RT, and that the effect of the mindfulness_score is negative, too.


### ICC


Not quite clear to which structure this function is referring to: to the persons or the blocks?
```{r}
icc(m01)
```



## Center/scale data

Let's normalize the data, to prevent convergence issues due to collinearity, to improve interpretatbility and to foster comparability of different precictors.

I will not standardize binary input, only continuous, following Andrew [Gelman's advice](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2009/07/11/when_to_standar/).



```{r}
d2 <- d %>% 
  std(mindfulness_score)
```


Check it:

```{r}
d2 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = mindfulness_score_z)) +
  geom_density()
```

Stats:

```{r}
d2 %>% 
  summarise(m_m = mean(mindfulness_score_z),
            m_sd = sd(mindfulness_score_z))
```


OK.


## `m02`: Refit m01 with standardized predictors


```{r}
m02 <- lmer(rt ~ 1 + factor(mindfulness_training) + mindfulness_score_z + (1|id) + (1|type),
            data = d2)

print(m02)
```


Not much change. No change in the random effects.


## Redefine outcome variable as deviation from gand mean in the expected direction

For theoretical reasons, it is expected that mindful individuals yield HIGHER `rt` in the FLIP-block (compared to non-mindfulness individuals). Similarly, it is epected that mindful individuals yield LOWER `rt` in the HOLD-block (compared to non-mindfulness individuals). 


Therefore, recoding or re-defining the outcome variable (`rt`) seems in place: The outcome is operationalized as the effect (in the expected direction). Such higher "effect" values show more deviation in `rt` from the grand mean.


### Grand (overall) rt median and mean


```{r}
rt_grand_summary <- d2 %>% 
  summarise(rt_grand_mean = mean(rt, na.rm = T),
            rt_grand_md = median(rt, na.rm = T),
            rt2_grand_mean = mean(rt_not_suspect, na.rm = T),
            rt2_grand_md = median(rt_not_suspect, na.rm = T))

rt_grand_summary


rt_grand_summary_l <- as.list(rt_grand_summary)
rt_grand_summary_l
```

Interestingly, the grand median does not change much, whereas the grand mean does change quite a bit.


### Compute `rt_effect`


`rt_effect` should be HIGH if the RT is HIGH and the block (type) is HOLD.
`rt_effect` should be HIGH if the RT is LOW and the block (type) is FLIP
`rt_effect` should be LOW if the RT is LOW and the block (type) is HOLD.
`rt_effect` should be LOW if the RT is HIGH and the block (type) is FLIP.

This idea is reflected in the following code:

```{r}
d3 <- d2 %>% 
  mutate(rt_delta_grand_md = rt - rt_grand_summary_l$rt_grand_md) %>% 
  select(id, rt, rt_delta_grand_md, everything()) %>% 
  mutate(rt_effect = case_when(
           (type == "hold") & (rt_delta_grand_md > 0) ~ rt_delta_grand_md * 1,
           (type == "hold") & (rt_delta_grand_md <= 0) ~ rt_delta_grand_md * -1,
           (type == "flip") & (rt_delta_grand_md > 0) ~ rt_delta_grand_md * -1,
           (type == "flip") & (rt_delta_grand_md <= 0) ~ rt_delta_grand_md * 1,
           TRUE ~ rt_delta_grand_md
         )) %>% 
  select(id, rt_effect, everything())
 
d3 
```




## `m03`: As `m02` but with `rt_effect` as outcome



```{r error = TRUE}
m03 <- lmer(rt_effect ~ 1 + factor(mindfulness_training) + mindfulness_score_z + (1|id) + (1|type),
            data = d3)

print(m03)
```


What went possibly wrong? 

Maybe the skewness in the outcome variable? Let's check this.


```{r}
gf_density(~rt_effect, data = d3)
```


Hm, that looks suspiciously that there are extreme effects which should not be there. Let's check that.


```{r}
d3 %>% 
  filter(percent_rank(rt_effect) < .01)
```


Too many extreme values! We should not work with the uncleaned, "dirty" data, but let's use the "suspicion-proofed" data instead, that is we should use the data were extreme values are replaced by NAs.




### Compute `rt_effect2`


`rt_effect2` refers to the sanitized, cleaned, rt (where the extrem values have been repalced by NAs), ie., `rt_not_suspect`.


Similarly, to what we've done above:


```{r}
d4 <- d3 %>% 
  mutate(rt2_delta_grand_md = rt_not_suspect - rt_grand_summary_l$rt2_grand_md) %>% 
  select(id, rt, rt2_delta_grand_md, everything()) %>% 
  mutate(rt2_effect = case_when(
           (type == "hold") & (rt2_delta_grand_md > 0) ~ rt2_delta_grand_md * 1,
           (type == "hold") & (rt2_delta_grand_md <= 0) ~ rt2_delta_grand_md * -1,
           (type == "flip") & (rt2_delta_grand_md > 0) ~ rt2_delta_grand_md * -1,
           (type == "flip") & (rt2_delta_grand_md <= 0) ~ rt2_delta_grand_md * 1,
           TRUE ~ rt2_delta_grand_md
         )) %>% 
  select(id, rt2_effect, everything())
 
d4
```

Let's check the distribution of `rt2_effect` as a first step.

```{r}
d4 %>% select(rt2_effect) %>% summary()

gf_dens(~ rt2_effect, data = d4)
```


The range appers to be ok. We see a marked bump left of zero, which remains to be explained.

As a histogram:


```{r}
gf_histogram(~ rt2_effect, data = d4)
```


As a qqplot:


```{r}
gf_qq(~ rt2_effect, data = d4) %>% 
  gf_qqline()
```


This does not look reassuring, but we might argue that we are NOT modeling y, but y conditional on the predictor values, so we wouldn't care about the distribution of y. Let's see...

Fit the model again:






## `m04`: As `m03` but with `rt2_effect` as outcome


Notice that the leading `1 + ` in the formula may be omitted according to this [vignette o lme4](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/vignettes/lmer.pdf).



```{r error = TRUE}
m04 <- lmer(rt2_effect ~ factor(mindfulness_training) + mindfulness_score_z + (1|id) + (1|type),
            data = d4, REML = FALSE)

print(m04)
```


Hm,failed to converge when `REML = TRUE`. So I set `REML = FALSE`. Now it converged. No clue why.

Mind that the effect (outcome variable) is `rt2_effect`.

The results seem to be promising:

- Mindfulness training has a positive effect on the effect.
- Mindfulness score has a positive effect.
- The SD of `type` is large compared to the person SD and compared to the residual ID.

### ICC

The ICC of `id` is approx: 

```{r}
ICCs_models <- list()


ICCs_models$m04$id <- 735.5 / ( 735.5 + 2203.5 + 1293.2)
ICCs_models$m04$id 
```

The ICC of `type` is approx:

```{r}
ICCs_models$m04$type <- 2203.5 / ( 735.5 + 2203.5 + 1293.2)
ICCs_models$m04$type 
```


### Check model assumptions 




```{r}
m04_diag <- augment(m04)
```


#### Linearity

According to Gelman and Hill 2007 this is the most important assumption.


```{r}
gf_point(.resid ~ .fitted, data = m04_diag)
```


Gosh, it looks as if there are some severe misspecification whopping around.



## `m05`: single level regression

Let's start anew. Let's see if we get somewhere using a very simple one-level (non-hierarchical regression).


Get the variables:

```{r}
d_small <- d4 %>% 
  select(id, is_suspicious_person, mindfulness_score_z, mindfulness_training, trials_count_flip, trials_count_hold)
```


Keep only the distinct values to come to level 2 (person) data:

```{r}
d_small2 <- d_small %>% 
  distinct()
```



Reshape the it, so sthat `trials_count_XXX` is a *long* variable, not a wide one.

```{r}
d_small3 <- d_small2 %>% 
  gather(key = type, value = trials_count, -c(id, is_suspicious_person, mindfulness_score_z, mindfulness_training))
```


Finally, run the linear modell on this data frame:


```{r}
m05 <- lm(trials_count ~ mindfulness_score_z + factor(mindfulness_training) + type, data = d_small3)
glance(m05)
tidy(m05)
```


We see that the mindfulness score appears not to play a role (according to its p-value), but the `type` is of relevance as is `mindfulness_training`.
